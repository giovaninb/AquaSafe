    <string name="risk_about_hazard">
        Occupational risk is the probability of occurrence of an adverse health effect due to exposure to a hazard (OHSAS 18001). In aquaculture activities, workers are exposed to different hazards, which may be physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic and psychosocial. To eliminate, avoid or mitigate health risks related to these hazards, it is necessary to establish hazard control and risk management. \n<b>The classification of risks may vary according to the legislation of each country.</b>\n
    </string>
    <string name="information_about_hazard">
According to occupational health and safety bodies, effective controls protect workers from workplace hazards. There is a wealth of information to help employers investigate options for controlling identified hazards. Before selecting any control measure, it is essential to request information from stakeholders (workers and employers) on their feasibility and effectiveness.\n
\n
• Employers should select the most viable, effective and permanent controls.\n\n
• Select controls according to a hierarchy that emphasizes solutions including elimination or replacement first, followed by safe work practices, administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.\n\n
• Avoid selecting controls that can directly or indirectly introduce new hazards.
</string>

    <string name="text_floating_equipment">
<b>Life jacket</b>"
• The lifejacket should allow the person to wear it correctly and quickly; be comfortable; resistant to different types of water, temperatures and faults;be provided with an oxidation resistant whistle, firmly attached to the vest.
• The lifejacket must take into account the weight and size of the user to allow stable buoyancy.
• Models with specific shape and volume collar are able to keep the face at a safe distance from the water or untap the person quickly in cases of unconsciousness. Check for models that have this specificity.
• Lifejackets are classified and should be used according to the form and conditions of use." \n

\n<b>Lifebuoys and lifelines</b>"
• The lifebuoys are devices for calm and inner waters in which help is always near. They are not safe for unconscious people or for long periods in the water.
• Life lines are used to rescue people in the water or to protect against falls.
</string>

    <string name="protective_clothing">
<b>Gloves</b>\n
• Gloves should be worn when handling animals, products, knives, needles, chemicals and hazardous substances.\n
• Wear work gloves if you have injuries, abrasions, or irritations on your hands and arms, except when using them may cause a risk.\n
• Rubber gloves can provide protection against moisture and cold.\n
• Anti-cutting gloves provide good protection when handling knives or materials with sharp edges.\n
• Fabric gloves can be worn underneath for even thermal comfort.\n
<b>• When working near a hoist, spear, saw or treadmill, tie long hair and do not wear loose clothing or jewelry.\n</b>

\n
<b>Shoes</b>\n
• Wear safety boots or shoes with good traction that avoid slipping and falling, as well as when operating vehicles and machines.\n
\n

• Clothing should be protected from prolonged exposure to cold weather, especially if clothing is soaked with water or by direct immersion, which can result in hypothermia, mental and muscular confusion, and death.\n
\n
<b>Hats and sun protection</b>\n
• Workers should wear a hat that holds direct sunlight away from their head, ears and face.\n
• They should be protected from direct sunlight and ultraviolet rays using sunscreen.\n
\n
<b>Wetsuit / diving equipment</b>\n
• Each diver must be equipped with a strong, sharp knife; weights with a quick release mechanism which are sufficient to control buoyancy; a diving suit or other protective clothing; and proper protection of the head while conducting a dive, which exposes the diver to risks of falling objects or head injuries.
</string>

    <string name="eye_protection_text">
• Protect eyes with safety or protective eyewear when activity requires eye protection.\n
• Workers should wear sunglasses to protect their eyes from direct sunlight or the reflection of water or ice.\n
• Do not wear standard sunglasses as a substitute for safety glasses when performing tasks that require the use of eye protection. For these tasks, wear appropriate glasses or protective masks.\n
</string>

    <string name="hearing_protection_text">
• Wear hearing protection (protectors and dampers) when using equipment or noisy machines (whenever the noise level exceeds 80 decibels). A good rule of thumb is if someone else is talking and can not be heard when they are at arm\'s length, then hearing protection should be used.\n
\n
• Some of the most common equipment used by fish farmers where hearing protection should be used include a chainsaw (115 decibels), a gasoline engine (100 decibels), a tractor (80-110 decibels), oyster washing machines (> 80 decibels).\n
</string>

    <string name="sign_protection_text">Place warning signs and emergency numbers in any chemical or noxious storage area. The signs should be placed according to the risks found in the workplace. \n

• "No smoking" signs should be affixed to all deposits or areas where flammable products are present.\n
• Fire extinguishers must be kept fully charged and renewed as specified by the manufacturer.\n
• Workers should be trained in the use of fire extinguishers.\n
\n

<b>Types of extinguishers:</b>\n
<b>• Chemical powder:</b> suitable for flammable liquids.\n
<b>• Carbon dioxide (CO2):</b> suitable for fires of electrical equipment.\n
<b>• Water:</b> Suitable for wood fires, fabric, paper and solid materials in general.\n
</string>

    <string name= "first_aid_text">

    <string name="chemical_protection_text">
The route of exposure or target organ damage of the chemical assists in making decisions about the protective equipment to be used.\n
\n
<b>Eyes</b>\n
• Danger of chemical or metallic splashes, dust, gas and vapor.\n
• Wear safety glasses, face shields, suitable visors.\n
\n
<b>Hands and arms</b>\n
• Danger of chemicals\n
• Wear gloves, gloves with wrists, mittens and sleeves that cover part or all of the arm. The choice of material should take into account the chemical product handled.\n
\n
<b>Feet and legs</b>\n
• Danger of chemicals\n
• Wear safety boots. Appropriate footwear should be selected for identified hazards including oil resistant soles or chemicals.\n
\n
<b>Lungs</b>\n
• Danger of dust, gas and vapors.\n
• Wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). Some respirators rely on the filtering of airborne contaminants in the workplace. These include simple filtering face masks and respirators. The right kind of respiratory filter should be used because each of them is effective only for a limited range of substances.\n
\n
<b>Whole body</b>\n
• Danger of splashes of chemicals.\n
• Wear conventional or disposable overalls, aprons.\n
</string>
    <string name="diving_protection_text">
• The diving equipment must be tested according to the manufacturer\'s specifications. The diving equipment test record must be maintained. Before use, you should check that it is working properly.\n
\n
• Dive team members who become aware of a malfunction or risk of diving equipment at the dive site must notify other divers who may be affected by the malfunction immediately. If the fault occurs during a dive and there are no replacements available on site, the dive must be immediately aborted in cooperation with the other members of the dive team.\n
\n
• Each diver must be equipped with a  sharp knife; weights with a quick release mechanism which are sufficient to control buoyancy; a diving suit or other protective clothing; and proper protection of the head while conducting a dive, which exposes the diver to risks of falling objects or head injuries.\n
\n
• A dive should not be performed if a health and safety hazard can be caused by equipment near the dive site.\n

It consists of identifying a problem and asking (at least) 5 \"why\" questions. The answer to the last why is the root cause of the problem.

The tool should be used with \'good judgment\', when you realize that reached the root of the problem just stop.</string>

PPE is the last line of defence and the least effective. Where there are still some residual risks that cannot be reduced by other means, the employer should provide appropriate PPE, such as coveralls, gloves, goggles, safety boots and hearing protectors.</string>
